    <h1>Starlink: SpaceX's satellite internet project</h1>
    <main class='main'>

        <section class='left section' style="width: 2000;">
      
          <p>Starlink is the name of a satellite network developed by the private spaceflight company SpaceX to provide low-cost internet to remote locations. SpaceX eventually hopes to have as many as 42,000 satellites in this so-called megaconstellation. </p>
      <p>Rather than sending internet signals through electric cables, which must be physically laid down to reach far-flung places, satellite internet works by beaming information through the vacuum of space, where it travels 47% faster than in fiber-optic cable</p>
      <p>As of early January 2022, SpaceX had launched more than 1,900 Starlink satellites overall. The constellation is now providing broadband service in select areas around the world, as part of a beta-test program with download speeds of between 100 Mb/s and 200 Mb/s and latency as low as 20 milliseconds, according to a Starlink guide.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: larger;">Technology can go where people cannot and where rescue efforts puts the lives of responders at risk
</h1>
<p style="font-size: large;">
Aerial robotics, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aka drones, show tremendous potential to 
transform humanitarian aid. Using this technology, organizations can map terrain more effectively, 
assess damage in real time, increase situational awareness through high-resolution mapping and deliver 
items faster, cheaper and more efficiently. Lower in cost, lighter in weight (as little as three pounds) 
and quieter than helicopters or planes, with pre-programmed routes that enable them to fly in 
life-threatening conditions, these “digital responders” provide access to otherwise unreachable areas. 
In addition, infrared cameras and advanced listening systems enable UAVs to uncover survivors from 
rubble or among flames and live-stream night footage, increasing the success of critical rescue efforts.</p>

    <h1>Success  Story of Mision PIURA</h1>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
      For example, global non-profit WeRobotics’ programme, AidRobotics, identifies local humanitarian needs 
      and incubates robotics solutions via regional Flying Labs™. Following extensive flooding in 2017, its 
      Peru Flying Labs formed the Mision PIURA multistakeholder consortium to create high-resolution aerial 
      images of more than 7,000 hectares (nearly 17,300 acres) in just three days. These maps provided 
      humanitarian agencies with a detailed understanding of the region including infrastructure damage,
      locations of stranded communities, safe areas for resettlement, and efficient routes for aid delivery. 
      Digital elevation models enabled the government to continually monitor water level changes throughout 
      the region.

<h1>Technology breaks down barriers to enable connectivity when we need it most</h1>
<p>In times of disaster, basic connectivity is a form of aid that connects people to the resources critical for survival and enables humanitarian organizations to quickly deliver life-saving information.

    Cisco’s Tactical Operations (TacOps), for example, takes advantage of the latest mobile networking technology, including cloud-controlled Meraki technology, to establish connectivity when disaster strikes, often faster than government or local providers can. The TacOps team, comprised of highly-skilled internet infrastructure specialists and supported by a global network of volunteers, can be ready to assist anywhere within a few days. From the refugee crisis in Uganda or Nepal’s 7.8 earthquake to Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria, since 2005, TacOps has responded to 45 disasters on six continents.In response to the refugee crisis alone, more than 600,000 devices have connected to TacOps’ networks in refugee camps across Europe. Additionally, in Puerto Rico, TacOps has brought efficiencies and speed to relief efforts with more than 66,500 unique clients (relief organizations and the public) and nearly 46 terabytes of data transferred within two months of installation.</p>
